#YouTube Clone
This is React application created with create-react-app for displaying videos of different categories.  
I'm using Material UI for styling the components. This app is also using Axios for fetching the videos from Rapid API which is free API for youtube videos.  
The app is made with React Router Dom version 6.  
You can render different videos by category. You can also search for specific video and the app will render it from YouTube via Rapid API.  
You can click on the video and then watch it. The likes and views are also valid for that specific video. On the right side I render similiar videos.  
You can check the app hosted live on netlify here:https://aleksandro-media.netlify.app/
